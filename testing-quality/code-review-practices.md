# Code Review Practices

## Concept Overview

Code review improves correctness, maintainability, security, and shared understanding before changes reach production.

In interview answers, keep the explanation practical: name the problem, show how the concept helps, and mention the cost or limitation.

## Why This Matters in a .NET Developer Interview

This role expects a developer who can build maintainable APIs and services using C#, ASP.NET Core, Azure, CI/CD, and modern engineering practices. **Code Review Practices** is likely to appear because it shows whether you can move beyond syntax and explain design decisions clearly in English.

Interviewers will listen for:
- Correct use of .NET terminology.
- Practical examples from backend systems.
- Awareness of maintainability, performance, security, and operations.
- Ability to explain trade-offs without overusing buzzwords.

## Practical Notes for .NET Projects

- Test behavior, not private implementation details.
- Use unit tests for business decisions and integration tests for real boundaries.
- Keep reviews focused on correctness, maintainability, security, and operational risk.
- Refactor with tests around the behavior you need to preserve.

## Key Interview Questions

| # | Level | Question |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Basic | What does Code Review Practices improve in a .NET codebase? |
| 2 | Basic | What should be covered by unit tests versus integration tests? |
| 3 | Intermediate | How would you test an order submission workflow that uses a database and a payment gateway? |
| 4 | Intermediate | How do you avoid brittle tests that only verify implementation details? |
| 5 | Advanced | How do you balance code quality work with delivery pressure? |
| 6 | Real-world scenario | A pull request changes billing behavior but has weak tests. What feedback would you give? |
| 7 | Advanced | How would you explain Code Review Practices to a product owner without using unnecessary jargon? |
| 8 | Real-world scenario | How would you migrate an existing production feature toward better use of Code Review Practices without stopping delivery? |

## Strong Sample Answers

1. **Definition answer:** Code Review Practices is useful when it improves the way a .NET service expresses business behavior, handles change, or protects runtime reliability. I would explain it with an example from an order, invoice, payment, inventory, or support workflow rather than only giving a definition.

2. **Practical value answer:** In a real ASP.NET Core application, Code Review Practices matters because it affects maintainability, testability, production diagnostics, performance, security, or the API contract. I look for the smallest implementation that solves the business problem without adding ceremony.

3. **Implementation answer:** I would start from the use case, define the boundary, keep dependencies explicit through DI, write tests around business behavior, and check the impact on API responses, persistence, logging, and deployment.

4. **Mistake answer:** A common mistake is applying Code Review Practices mechanically. I would avoid adding patterns or infrastructure unless they reduce real risk, duplication, or coupling in the codebase.

5. **Senior answer:** The trade-off is usually between simplicity now and flexibility later. I would consider team experience, operational cost, data consistency, failure handling, and whether the design is easy for another developer to review and support.

6. **Scenario answer:** If an order API is slow or hard to change, I would measure first, identify whether the issue is database access, coupling, deployment, unclear boundaries, or weak observability, then apply Code Review Practices where it directly addresses that bottleneck.

7. **Communication answer:** I would describe Code Review Practices in business terms: it either lowers release risk, makes customer-facing behavior more predictable, or makes failures easier to recover from.

8. **Migration answer:** I would not rewrite everything. I would choose one high-value workflow, add tests, introduce the improved design behind the existing API contract, release incrementally, and monitor behavior after deployment.

## Coding Example

```csharp
public sealed class PaymentService
{
    private readonly IPaymentGateway _gateway;
    private readonly ILogger<PaymentService> _logger;

    public PaymentService(IPaymentGateway gateway, ILogger<PaymentService> logger)
    {
        _gateway = gateway;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task<PaymentResult> CaptureAsync(Guid invoiceId, decimal amount, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Capturing payment for invoice {InvoiceId}", invoiceId);
        return await _gateway.CaptureAsync(invoiceId, amount, ct);
    }
}
```

## Real-World Scenario

You are building an order management capability for a commerce platform.

The business requires:
- Customers can place orders and review order status.
- Inventory, payment, and notification workflows must stay reliable.
- Support staff need clear diagnostics when something fails.
- The system must be deployable without long downtime.

For **Code Review Practices**, a strong candidate should connect the concept to this business flow, explain the technical decision, call out the cost of the decision, and describe how they would verify it in production. The interviewer is usually looking for practical reasoning: not just what the concept means, but when it improves maintainability, reliability, performance, or team delivery.

## Common Mistakes

- Memorizing a definition of Code Review Practices but failing to connect it to a production problem.
- Adding unnecessary abstraction before there is a clear reason.
- Ignoring error handling, logging, validation, and testing around the implementation.
- Treating the concept as a rule instead of a design tool.
- Not explaining trade-offs such as complexity, performance, team familiarity, and operational support.

## Follow-Up Questions an Interviewer May Ask

- How would you test this?
- How would you monitor it in production?
- What would make you choose a simpler approach?
- How would this design behave during partial failure?
- How would you explain this decision in a code review?
- What would you change if the traffic increased by ten times?

## Senior-Level Explanation and Trade-Off Discussion

A senior explanation of **Code Review Practices** should balance correctness and cost. The best answer usually says, "I would use this when the business risk or code complexity justifies it." For a 3+ year .NET developer, interviewers expect awareness that every pattern adds maintenance work. The stronger answer describes how the decision affects testing, deployment, observability, data consistency, and future changes.
