# Aggregates

## Concept Explanation

Aggregates group domain objects behind a consistency boundary and enforce invariants through an aggregate root.

For architecture and design work, focus on the boundary this concept creates, the dependency direction it encourages, and the business problem it protects. The important part is not naming a pattern; it is explaining how the pattern keeps rules, data flow, and change isolated enough for the team to maintain the system.

When discussing it in an interview, connect the concept to a realistic service design decision. Describe what code would live where, how the design would be tested, what operational or delivery risk it reduces, and when the extra structure would become unnecessary ceremony.

## Why This Matters in a .NET Developer Interview

This role expects a developer who can build maintainable APIs and services using C#, ASP.NET Core, Azure, CI/CD, and modern engineering practices. **Aggregates** is likely to appear because it shows whether you can move beyond syntax and explain design decisions clearly in English.

Interviewers will listen for:
- Correct use of .NET terminology.
- Practical examples from backend systems.
- Awareness of maintainability, performance, security, and operations.
- Ability to explain trade-offs without overusing buzzwords.

## Practical Notes for .NET Projects

- Start from business use cases and consistency boundaries, not from patterns.
- Keep framework dependencies at the edges when business rules are important.
- Use abstractions to protect meaningful boundaries, not to hide every concrete class.
- Make design decisions easy to test and easy to explain in a code review.

## Key Interview Questions

| # | Level | Question |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Basic | What is Aggregates, and where have you used it in a .NET backend project? |
| 2 | Basic | What problem does Aggregates solve for an API or business application? |
| 3 | Intermediate | How would you implement or apply Aggregates in an ASP.NET Core service? |
| 4 | Intermediate | What are common mistakes developers make with Aggregates? |
| 5 | Advanced | What trade-offs should a senior developer consider before using Aggregates? |
| 6 | Real-world scenario | An order API is slow, hard to test, and risky to deploy. How could Aggregates help, and what would you check first? |

## Strong Sample Answers

1. **Definition answer:** Aggregates is useful when it improves the way a .NET service expresses business behavior, handles change, or protects runtime reliability. I would explain it with an example from an order, invoice, payment, inventory, or support workflow rather than only giving a definition.

2. **Practical value answer:** In a real ASP.NET Core application, Aggregates matters because it affects maintainability, testability, production diagnostics, performance, security, or the API contract. I look for the smallest implementation that solves the business problem without adding ceremony.

3. **Implementation answer:** I would start from the use case, define the boundary, keep dependencies explicit through DI, write tests around business behavior, and check the impact on API responses, persistence, logging, and deployment.

4. **Mistake answer:** A common mistake is applying Aggregates mechanically. I would avoid adding patterns or infrastructure unless they reduce real risk, duplication, or coupling in the codebase.

5. **Senior answer:** The trade-off is usually between simplicity now and flexibility later. I would consider team experience, operational cost, data consistency, failure handling, and whether the design is easy for another developer to review and support.

6. **Scenario answer:** If an order API is slow or hard to change, I would measure first, identify whether the issue is database access, coupling, deployment, unclear boundaries, or weak observability, then apply Aggregates where it directly addresses that bottleneck.

## Coding Example

```csharp
public sealed class Order
{
    private readonly List<OrderLine> _lines = [];
    public Guid Id { get; private set; } = Guid.NewGuid();
    public OrderStatus Status { get; private set; } = OrderStatus.Draft;
    public IReadOnlyCollection<OrderLine> Lines => _lines.AsReadOnly();

    public void AddLine(Guid productId, int quantity, Money unitPrice)
    {
        if (Status != OrderStatus.Draft)
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Only draft orders can be changed.");

        _lines.Add(new OrderLine(productId, quantity, unitPrice));
    }

    public void Confirm()
    {
        if (_lines.Count == 0)
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Cannot confirm an empty order.");

        Status = OrderStatus.Confirmed;
    }
}

public sealed record Money(decimal Amount, string Currency);
```

## Real-World Scenario

You are building an order management capability for a commerce platform.

The business requires:
- Customers can place orders and review order status.
- Inventory, payment, and notification workflows must stay reliable.
- Support staff need clear diagnostics when something fails.
- The system must be deployable without long downtime.

For **Aggregates**, a strong candidate should connect the concept to this business flow, explain the technical decision, call out the cost of the decision, and describe how they would verify it in production. The interviewer is usually looking for practical reasoning: not just what the concept means, but when it improves maintainability, reliability, performance, or team delivery.

## Common Mistakes

- Memorizing a definition of Aggregates but failing to connect it to a production problem.
- Adding unnecessary abstraction before there is a clear reason.
- Ignoring error handling, logging, validation, and testing around the implementation.
- Treating the concept as a rule instead of a design tool.
- Not explaining trade-offs such as complexity, performance, team familiarity, and operational support.

## Follow-Up Questions an Interviewer May Ask

- How would you test this?
- How would you monitor it in production?
- What would make you choose a simpler approach?
- How would this design behave during partial failure?
- How would you explain this decision in a code review?
- What would you change if the traffic increased by ten times?

## Senior-Level Explanation and Trade-Off Discussion

A senior explanation of **Aggregates** should balance correctness and cost. The best answer usually says, "I would use this when the business risk or code complexity justifies it." For a 3+ year .NET developer, interviewers expect awareness that every pattern adds maintenance work. The stronger answer describes how the decision affects testing, deployment, observability, data consistency, and future changes.
